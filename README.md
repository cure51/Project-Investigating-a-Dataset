# Investigating a Dataset- Baseball's Elite Hitters

Analysis of the top players in a given sport can help uncover useful insights for both the individual and team. In this analysis, I’ll primarily look at characteristics of “elite hitters.” Later in the analysis of elite hitters, I will make an investigation into the statistical impact of performance-enhancing drugs on the overall population of elite hitters. Numpy and Pandas modules were the primary libraries used to analyze the dataset.
